## Description

In this assignment we were tasked with creating a website that would accurately display the current weather of whichever city the user input while also displaying the forecast for the next 5 days. We were given a third party API called One Call Weather that could be manipulated in a way to spit out this information to us. In order to do this I had to create three separate functions in order to convert the information that this API into legible information that the user can view.

The first function was for the current temperature of the city in which I was able to add the information onto a card that I pulled from Bootstrap. The next function was much more challenging as I had to create cards through JavaScript that would display the future forecast. Since this was a lot more infomation to process compared to the first function, I spent the majority of my time working on this function. I also had to add icons that would display that days weather that I had to retrieve from another API called FontAwesome. The last function I created was used to store and display the past cities that were inputted.
